## 💡 Power User Tips

### Tip 1: Rapid Context Switching

```javascript
// Scenario: Working on 5 different projects

Morning Project Review:
1. Click space button
2. See all 5 projects
3. Scan time since last edit:
   - Project A: 2h ago (active)
   - Project B: 1d ago (needs update)
   - Project C: 3d ago (check progress)
   - Project D: 1w ago (low priority)
   - Project E: 2w ago (archived?)

4. Prioritize based on recency
5. One-click to each project

Time Saved: ~10 minutes per day
```

### Tip 2: Space Name Patterns

```javascript
// Use consistent naming for better organization

Good Patterns:
✅ "Project: AI Ethics Research"
✅ "Client: Acme Corp Analysis"
✅ "Learning: Python Advanced"
✅ "Personal: Weekend Reading"

Why It Works:
- Easy to scan in dropdown
- Clear categorization
- Alphabetical grouping
- Quick identification

Example History:
1. ⭐ Project: AI Ethics Research
2. Client: Acme Corp Analysis
3. Learning: Python Advanced
4. Personal: Weekend Reading
```

### Tip 3: Access Count Analysis

```javascript
// Use access counts to identify important spaces

High Access (10+ visits):
→ Core working spaces
→ Frequently referenced
→ Keep at top of mind

Medium Access (5-9 visits):
→ Ongoing projects
→ Regular check-ins
→ Active development

Low Access (1-4 visits):
→ One-time research
→ Archived topics
→ Consider archiving

Example Decision:
Space A: 25 visits → Daily driver
Space B: 8 visits → Weekly check
Space C: 2 visits → Review & archive
```
