### Contributing Code

#### Site Adapters

If you'd like to add support for a new video site:

1. Create a new adapter file in the `site-adapters/` directory
2. Use the `ExampleAdapter.js` as a template
3. Follow the adapter structure and naming conventions
4. Test thoroughly on the target site
5. Document the adapter in `site-adapters/README.md`

#### Userscript Improvements

When improving existing userscripts:

1. Ensure backward compatibility when possible
2. Test with multiple video sites
3. Document any new configuration options
4. Update the userscript version number
5. Add comments explaining complex logic

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Min Browser](https://minbrowser.org/) installed
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Git for version control

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/min-browser-enhancement-suite.git
   cd min-browser-enhancement-suite
   ```

3. Create a symbolic link to your Min Browser userscripts directory:
   ```bash
   # macOS example
   ln -s $(pwd)/userscripts /Users/YOUR-USERNAME/Library/Application\ Support/Min/userscripts
   ```

4. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clear, commented code
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Test your changes thoroughly

3. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
   ```

   Commit message guidelines:
   - Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
   - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
   - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

4. **Push to Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Go to the original repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your feature branch
   - Fill out the PR template with details about your changes

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Use 2 or 4 spaces for indentation (be consistent with the file you're editing)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Wrap code in IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) for userscripts
- Use strict mode: `'use strict';`

### Userscript Headers

Always include proper userscript headers:

```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Your Script Name
// @namespace    https://min.userscripts
// @version      1.0
// @description  Brief description of what the script does
// @match        *://*/*
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==
```

### Code Comments

- Add JSDoc-style comments for functions:
  ```javascript
  /**
   * Brief description of function
   * @param {Type} paramName - Description of parameter
   * @returns {Type} Description of return value
   */
  ```

- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Testing Your Changes

### Manual Testing

1. **Install the Modified Userscripts**
   - Copy your modified scripts to Min's userscripts directory
   - Restart Min Browser or reload the scripts

2. **Test on Multiple Sites**
   - Test on at least 3-5 different video sites
   - Verify the feature works as expected
   - Check for console errors

3. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Multiple videos on the same page
   - Dynamic content loading
   - Different video players (HTML5, embedded, etc.)
   - Mobile/responsive views

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Check CPU usage
   - Monitor memory consumption
   - Verify smooth video playback
   - Test with multiple tabs open

### Browser Console Testing

Open the browser console (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I) to:
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Verify debug messages from your scripts
- Test script functionality interactively

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**
